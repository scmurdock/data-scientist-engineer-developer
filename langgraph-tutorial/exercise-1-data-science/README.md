# Exercise 1: Data Science - Web Data Exploration

**Role:** Data Scientist  
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Goal:** Analyze web content to understand patterns and prepare data for the pipeline

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use JavaScript for data analysis (pandas/numpy equivalent)
- Implement web scraping with error handling
- Generate statistical insights from unstructured data
- Create data summaries for downstream processing

## 📋 Your Mission

You're analyzing technology blog posts to understand trending topics. Your analysis will inform what content gets processed into embeddings.

## 🛠️ TODO List (Complete in Order)

### Step 1: Basic Data Collection (10 min)
- [ ] Run the starter code to see the scaffolding
- [ ] Complete the `fetchWebContent()` function
- [ ] Add error handling for failed requests
- [ ] Test with 3-5 tech blog URLs

### Step 2: Data Analysis (20 min)  
- [ ] Complete the `analyzeTextContent()` function
- [ ] Implement word frequency analysis
- [ ] Calculate readability metrics
- [ ] Generate content statistics

### Step 3: Data Insights (15 min)
- [ ] Complete the `generateInsights()` function
- [ ] Identify trending topics
- [ ] Create data quality report
- [ ] Export findings for data engineers

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd exercise-1-data-science
node starter-code.js
```

## 📊 Expected Output

```
=== WEB CONTENT ANALYSIS RESULTS ===
Analyzed 5 articles
Average length: 1,247 words
Top topics: ["AI", "JavaScript", "Machine Learning"]
Quality score: 8.2/10
Recommendation: Process all articles for embeddings
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Data Quality Assessment**: Not all web content is suitable for embeddings
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use JavaScript like you would use pandas
- **Insight Generation**: Summarize findings for technical handoff

## 🔍 Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully fetch and parse 5+ web articles
- [ ] Generate meaningful statistics about content
- [ ] Identify which content should be processed further
- [ ] Create data summary for Exercise 2

## 🆘 Stuck? Quick Tips

- Focus on TODO comments only
- The scaffolding handles complex parts
- Use `console.log()` liberally for debugging
- Don't optimize - just get it working
